# Inspectr

We're developing an app that takes restaurant inspection data from publicly available websites and makes it easy to access to the public.  We are planning to contribute data to Socrata OpenData the data to OpenStreetMap.   We're starting with Atlanta, then scaling to Georgia.  This project started on 6/6/15 at the Atlanta Hack for Change event.

#### Quick Start ####
1. Git clone or download this code onto your computer
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
3. Optionally, modify run.rb to set the dates you want to scrape
4. Run `run.rb` from your command line using `bundle exec ruby run.rb`
5. Find your data in CSV format in the `data/` directory. This will not sync to Git.

#### Looking for the data? ####
We are currently publishing data at https://brigades.opendatanetwork.com/d/jzeg-w743
